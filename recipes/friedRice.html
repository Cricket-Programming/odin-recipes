        <ol class="steps">
            <li>
                Prep and Scramble Eggs: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil (or butter) in
                 a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beaten 
                 eggs and scramble them until cooked through. Transfer the cooked
                  eggs to a separate bowl and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook vegetables and aromatics: Add another tablespoon of oil to the same wok or skillet. 
                Stir in the onions, bell peppers, and scallions. Cook for 3-4 minutes until they are tender 
                and fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fry the rice: add a chilled, cooked rice to the pan, breaking up any chunks with your spatula. 
                Stir constantly to combine the rice with the vegetables.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season and combine: Pour the soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using) and sesame oil over the rice mixture. Continue to stir fry for 3-5 minutes, 
                allowing some of the rice grains to brown and crisp by letting them rest briefly on the hot pan between stirs.
            </li>
